#  Dengue Prediction Model

A machine learning project to predict the number of Dengue cases based on climatic and environmental variables. This model aims to assist public health authorities in anticipating outbreaks and taking preventive measures.

##  Overview

This project leverages historical weather and dengue case data to train machine learning models that can forecast future dengue incidence. It uses Python and Scikit-learn for data processing, visualization, and model evaluation.

##  Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

---

##  What it does:
The project compares models and evaluates them using:

Accuracy score

Confusion matrix

Visual plots

Based on these metrics, the most effective model is selected for potential deployment.
