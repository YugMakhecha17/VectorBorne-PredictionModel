#  Dengue Prediction Model

A machine learning project to predict the number of Dengue cases based on climatic and environmental variables. This model aims to assist public health authorities in anticipating outbreaks and taking preventive measures.

##  Overview

This project leverages historical weather and dengue case data to train machine learning models that can forecast future dengue incidence. It uses Python and Scikit-learn for data processing, visualization, and model evaluation.

##  Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Visualization of Predictions
- Accuracy and Confusion Matrix Reports

---

##  Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
git clone https://github.com/YugMakhecha17/DenguePredictionModel.git
cd DenguePredictionModel

jupyter notebook DenguePredictionModel.ipynb


The project compares three classification models and evaluates them using:

Accuracy score

Confusion matrix

Visual plots

Based on these metrics, the most effective model is selected for potential deployment.
